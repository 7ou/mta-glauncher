MTA Grenade Launcher
=============
Features
--------
Grenade launcher resource for MTA San Andreas.

Aim with your AK-47, and press E to fire a grenade. Grenades explode on contact and you need to reload between each round you fire.

To get the reload system to work, the reload resource was slightly modified, and is included in this folder.

Todo
--------
* Add proper class / team / ACL group protection
* Add proper ammo limitation and calculation
* Add proper out-of-ammo messaging

Known Bugs
--------
* The reload management can get bugged when repeatedly triggered.
* Grenades may directly explode when launched while travelling at high velocities.
